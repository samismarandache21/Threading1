🧵 Threading1 – C Multithreading Examples
A collection of C programs demonstrating multithreading concepts using the POSIX Threads (pthreads) library.

🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains multiple C source files, each illustrating different aspects of multithreading:

Source.c: Introduces basic thread creation and joining techniques.​
Source2.c: Explores synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes to prevent race conditions.​
Source3.c: Demonstrates advanced topics like thread communication and condition variables.​
🛠️ Technologies Used
C Programming Language: Core language for system-level programming.​
POSIX Threads (pthreads): Standard library for multithreading in Unix-like systems.
🌟 Key Learnings
Thread Creation and Management: Understanding how to create and manage multiple threads in a C program.​
Synchronization Techniques: Implementing mutexes and condition variables to synchronize thread execution.​
Concurrency Challenges: Addressing common issues such as race conditions and deadlocks.
